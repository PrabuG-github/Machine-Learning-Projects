<h1> Solve this question</h1>

<h4>1. You are provided with the weekly sales data for their various outlets. Use statistical
analysis, EDA, outlier analysis, and handling  the missing values to come up with various
insights that can give them a clear perspective on the following:</h4>
<li>If the weekly sales are affected by the unemployment rate, if yes, which stores
are suffering the most?</li>
<li>If the weekly sales show a seasonal trend, when and what could be the reason?</li>
<li>Does temperature affect the weekly sales in any manner?</li>
<li>How is the Consumer Price Index affecting the weekly sales of various stores?</li>
<li>Top-performing stores according to historical data.</li>
<li>The worst-performing store, and how significant is the difference between the
highest and lowest-performing stores.</li>

<h4>2. Use predictive modeling techniques to forecast the sales for each store for the next 12
weeks.</h4>
